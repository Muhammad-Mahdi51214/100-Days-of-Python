# BMI Calculator

# Round Function that is used to round any floating value into dpecifed decimal places..
# function---->  round(8/3,2)
# / operator always gives the floating point number 
# // operator is used to  get integer point number
# f-string is the advanced version to print it without converting to int or other data type
